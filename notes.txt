observers/models overcooked. Refocus on the game!

I think there's still value in the loader though -
Maybe not Model classes, but prefilling defaults, resolving references.
Can use the same mapping
--
replace models with entities - dumb data.
entities with references?
player has inventory
player.inventory = [
  { $ref: 'some/path/#name' },
]

player.getInventory
player.addToInventory
player.getInventoryItem
player.removeFromInventory

player.getCurrentWeapon
player.assignCurrentWeapon

weapon and inventory should persist alongside actor/player entity data.


--
player: some character with state that we can persist.
players state == game state
tile data: includes location attributes, item/encounter/npc references
region data: list of tiles, maybe some metadata on entry points?
items: types from modules, specific instances are unique?
npcs: ditto
encounters: modules/generic module can examine tile and play out encounter based on npcs, items etc.


some mvps:
 - play through adventure without combat
   start at some point.
   explore map
   encounters and special items on tiles as far as necessary to unlock adventure
   quest logic and completion


start the game
  load saved game / init new game
  load tiles
  render map
  enter initial tile

game
  - container for tiles/regions
  - pointers to current tile
  (delegates from player?)

player state (game state really)
 - save/replay game, needs:
  - history
  - current tile
  - inventory, stats

tile data - static tile data. scripts/interactions
  - items/inventory
  - npcs
  - encounters/behaviors

minimal working UI:
- render some attributes of the current tile
- display player icon with some attributes
- display choices: tile == whole screen.
- n/s/e/w buttons - enabled/disabled as appropriate

-we move from tile a to tile b
  render description/graphics for this tile
  update player visited history
  things that happen when player enters the tile

we engage with NPC
  dialog happens
  inventory is exchanged
  history is updated, some flag is set?

we combat monster
  monster has inventory
  monster has stats
  when monster is dead,
    announce deadness/victory as part of combat
    render change in monster state,
    update tile if the monster was part of the static story/contents of that tile
    the monster's inventory is transfered to the tile
    score update

something is added to player inventory
  update rendering of inventory list
  if its a special item, trigger subroutine
  take it out of wherever it came from


--
observer/subscriber thoughts:

model property 'bar' on 'foo' changed.
resolve 'bar' to some unambiguous id, get listeners and hand event to them

model ids are auto-generated.
So if we want the UI to display player attributes we might say:
on player attribute change -> update && render
where player is an object created and re-created at runtime
so we need to alias 'player model id' to 'player' whenever we (re)create player
location is a fixed reference to the current tile.
 it points at different tile objects at runtime
 we want to be able to have the UI render location and any changes
 so when location is updated (its an observable) it dispatches an event

location is a getter to tiles[current_position]
  tile property changes publish tile_id/contents:change
  switchboard looks up tile_id, discovers it is aliased as 'location' and re-broadcasts

  /map/:region/:tile
* npc
  /:npcid
* item
  /:itemid
* world
  /:coords
  -> { region: { tiles: [], bounds: {type:'rect', pts: []} }}


place the player into the world, and the starting point
 - the player object
 - enough of the map to show the starting point
 - any objects associated with that pt/region
 - any encounter scripts or other region-logic
 - trigger enter the region
 - trigger enter the tile

the game loads the world location:
  it gets any game state, starts timers, and so on.
the game loads the player
  it gets any saved location, stats, inventory
the game loads the starting location
  it returns the region and the current tile
  (we can pass a coord and it resolves this )
